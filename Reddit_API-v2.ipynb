Dhoni started as a brash young star with a lot of potential. He got out to playing rash shots. Even his wicketkeeping was questioned my stalwarts.(Same applies to Pant) \\nDhoni initially tasted success in Test Cricket with that 148 against Pakistan.(Pant too, has scored test centuries in England and Australia- the first Indian 'keeper to ever do so.) \\nDhoni, with time became more matured and moulded his game. Most importantly,Dhoni had the backing of Sourav Ganguly (The then Indian Captain) \\nThe Indian cricket team management seems to be going the wrong way with Pant. \\nHe needs all the backing to succeed. He just needs to play his natural game. Success and maturity will come eventually.\",\n",

If it hadn't been for his stature as a captain (which he wasn't a great one in tests) and world cup winner, I doubt he would have played the 90 tests that he did.\\n\\nThat said, I've always felt that Dhoni was an underachiever in test cricket. As his recent run has shown, he can be a very good defensive player. But I felt he was pigeonholed as an attacking batsman which impacted the way he approached test cricket.\\n\\nHe didn't have orthodox technique, but he has this ability to just grit it out. IMO, he could have been a Laxman-tier batsman for India\",\n",

Whenever the question of dropping them comes up, fans tout that they are 'irreplacable' because they have an average of 50, even though recent averages are somewhere in the 20s or low 30s, which is not good enough to win matches. Selectors too are unwilling to look past the glory and glamour of such players not realizing that they would do better to groom some talented young blood in their place.\"]}"
